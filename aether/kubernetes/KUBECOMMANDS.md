Certainly! Here's a plug-and-play ready template of commands to launch the training job using the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl):

```bash
# Create a Kubernetes deployment using the YAML file
kubectl apply -f template.yaml

# Monitor the status of the deployment and wait for all pods to become ready
kubectl rollout status deployment/training-deployment

# Get information about the pods in the deployment
kubectl get pods

# Stream the logs of the training pods to monitor the training progress
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>

# To stop streaming the logs, press Ctrl+C

# Once the training is complete, you can retrieve the trained model or perform any post-training tasks
# For example, to copy the trained model to a local directory, you can use the following command
kubectl cp <pod-name>:/path/to/trained/model /local/directory

# Clean up the deployment and associated resources when you're done
kubectl delete deployment training-deployment
```

Make sure to replace `template.yaml` with the actual filename of your deployment YAML file. Also, replace `<pod-name>` with the name of the pod running the training job, which you can obtain by running `kubectl get pods`.

Feel free to customize the commands further based on your specific requirements and configurations.
